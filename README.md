# AgriTech---USGS LIDAR
## Overview
This project is about the job that will be done for Agri tech, which is a company that is very interested in to know how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help them to improve thier research on new agricultural products that is being tested on farms. How much maize a field produces is very spatially variable. Even if the same farming practices, seeds and fertilizer are applied exactly the same by machinery over a field, there can be a very large harvest at one corner and a low harvest at another corner.  They would like to be able to better understand which parts of the farm are likely to produce more or less maize, so that if they try a new fertilizer on part of this farm, they will have more confidence that any differences in the maize harvest are due mostly to the new fertilizer changes, and not just random effects due to other environmental factors.
